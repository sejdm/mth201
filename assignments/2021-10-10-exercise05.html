        <ol>
<li><p>Compute <span class="math inline">\(\ddot{\mathbf{N}}_s(t)\)</span> as a linear combination of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{N}_s(t)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>For a regular plane curve parametrized by <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(t)\)</span>, the curve parametrized by <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_c(t) := \gamma(t) + c \mathbf{N}_s(t)\)</span> for some fixed number <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, is said to be "parallel to the curve parametrized by <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(t)\)</span>".</p>
<ol>
<li><p>What is the curve parallel to a circle of radius <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>?</p></li>
<li><p>Prove that the <span class="math inline">\(\dot{\gamma}_c(t)\)</span> is a scalar multiple of <span class="math inline">\(\dot{\gamma}(t)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Compute the signed curvature of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_c(t)\)</span> in terms of the signed curvature fuction, <span class="math inline">\(k(t)\)</span>, for <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>. You will need to assume that <span class="math inline">\(k(t) \neq 1/c\)</span>. Hint: Just as in the previous exercise, it may be useful to express <span class="math inline">\(\ddot{\gamma}_c(t)\)</span> in terms of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{N}_s(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}(t)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{N}_s(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}(t)\)</span> are the unit normal and unit tangent vectors, respectively, of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(t)\)</span> and compute the coefficients by taking the dot product with appropriate vectors.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>If a curve parametrized by <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> has signed curvature function <span class="math inline">\(\kappa_s(t)\)</span>, what is the signed curvature of the curve parametrizaed by <span class="math inline">\(c\gamma(t)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is some constant?</p></li>
<li><p>Prove that for a space curve parametrized by a *unit-speed parametrization*, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma : (a, b) \to \mathbb{R}^3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{N}(t) := \frac{\ddot{\gamma}(t)}{\kappa(t)}=\frac{\dot{T}(t)}{\|T(t)\|}\)</span> is a unit vector which is orthogonal to the unit tangent vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}(t)= \frac{\dot{\gamma}(t)}{\|\dot{\gamma}(t)\|}\)</span>. Note, here <span class="math inline">\(\kappa\)</span> is the curvature and *not* the signed curvature, which only makes sense for plane curves. Note also that all this makes sense only if <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is regular and <span class="math inline">\(\kappa(t) \neq 0\)</span> (it appears in the denominator!)</p></li>
<li><p>Consider a (plane) curve parametrized by <span class="math inline">\(\gamma : (a, b) \to \mathbf{R}^2\)</span> and a point on that curve <span class="math inline">\(p = \gamma(t_0)\)</span>. We will find a circle which best approximates the curve at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, in the sense defined below. This will give another perspective on curvature. To solve this exercise, you need to be familiar with using derivatives to find out local maxima or minima.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Prove that if a circle is tangent to the curve defined by <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> ("tangent" means that the circle touches the curve and the circle’s tangent line and the curve’s tangent line are the same at p), then its center must lie on the line containing the vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{N}_s(t)\)</span>. For this and the part below you may assume that a normal line of a circle contains its center.</p></li>
<li><p>For some real number <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, let <span class="math inline">\(C_r\)</span> denote the circle of radius <span class="math inline">\(|r|\)</span>, with its center at the point <span class="math inline">\(p + r\mathbf{N}_s(t)\)</span>. Why is it tangent to the curve at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>? Note that <span class="math inline">\(C_r\)</span> divides the plane into an interior and exterior component and <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> may be negative, in which case the center is in a direction opposite to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{N}_s(t)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Prove that a point <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(t)\)</span> avoids the interior component of <span class="math inline">\(C_r\)</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">\(d(t) := \|\gamma(t) - (p + r\mathbf{N}(t))\|^2 \geq r^2\)</span> and avoids the exterior component if and only if <span class="math inline">\(d(t) \leq r^2\)</span> (it always intersects the circle at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, so at <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> you get <span class="math inline">\(r^2\)</span>). The square is only to allow us to express it as a dot product. Since <span class="math inline">\(d(t)\)</span> always positive, taking the square is harmless.</p></li>
<li><p>We say that <span class="math inline">\(C_r\)</span> is too small if, at least in the vicinity of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, every point on the curve defined by <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> avoids the interior of <span class="math inline">\(C_r\)</span>, i.e. there is an <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> so that for any <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> inside the interval <span class="math inline">\((t_0 - \epsilon, t_0 + \epsilon)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(t)\)</span> avoids the interior of <span class="math inline">\(C_r\)</span>. Use the previous part to rewrite this in terms of the function <span class="math inline">\(d(t)\)</span>, which is defined above. Why does that mean that <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> has a local minimum at <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span>? Remember that a function has a local minimum at <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> if for <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> *in the vicinity* of <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f(t) \geq f(t_0)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>We say that <span class="math inline">\(C_r\)</span> is too big if, at least in the vicinity of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, every point on the curve defined by <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> avoids the exterior of <span class="math inline">\(C_r\)</span>, i.e. there is an <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> so that for any <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> inside the interval <span class="math inline">\((t_0 - \epsilon, t_0 + \epsilon)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(t)\)</span> avoids the exterior of <span class="math inline">\(C_r\)</span>. Use the previous part to rewrite this in terms of the function <span class="math inline">\(d(t)\)</span>, which is defined above. Why does that mean that <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> has a local maximum at <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span>?</p></li>
<li><p>Prove that no matter what <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is, <span class="math inline">\(d'(t_0) = 0\)</span>. (By now you should be in the habit of expressing such derivatives in terms of that orthonormal basis <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{N}_s(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}(t)\)</span> so that you can easily identify which coefficients cancel).</p></li>
<li><p>Remember that a function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> has a local maximum at <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(f'(t_0)=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f''(t_0)&lt;0\)</span>; it has a local minimum at <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(f'(t_0)=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f''(t_0)&gt;0\)</span>. Compute <span class="math inline">\(d''(t)\)</span> and use parts d) and e) above to show that <span class="math inline">\(C_r\)</span> would be too big if <span class="math inline">\(r&gt;1/\kappa(t_0)\)</span> and too small if <span class="math inline">\(r &lt; 1/\kappa(t_0)\)</span>. Therefore, a circle of radius <span class="math inline">\(1/\kappa(t_0)\)</span> may be thought of as best approximating the curve at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Such a circle is called an *osculating circle* and its radius is <span class="math inline">\(1/\kappa(t_0)\)</span> is called the radius of curvature.</p></li>
