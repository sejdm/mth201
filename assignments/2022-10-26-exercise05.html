        <h1 id="additional-exercises">Additional exercises</h1>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> These exercises repeat many of the concepts / exrecises covered earlier and are meant for you to identify gaps in your understanding. It includes concepts covered during the lectures by breaking them down into smaller exercises. They are not exhaustive and the mid-semester examination will not be restricted to these questions, however, hopefully these questions will help you to revise some of the concepts.</p>
<h2 id="curves-on-surfaces">Curves on surfaces</h2>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(S \subset \mathbb{R}^3\)</span> be a part of a surface and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma : U \to S\)</span> be a regular surface patch.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>For each of the surface patches below, identify the surface that they (partially) cover:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\sigma : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma(x,y) = (x, y, 0)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\sigma : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma(x,y) = (x, y, x+y)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\sigma : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma(x,y) = (\cos(x), \sin(x), y)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\sigma : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma(x,y) = (x, y, \sqrt{r^2 - x^2 - y^2})\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\sigma : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma(x,y) = (x, y, \sqrt{r^2 - x^2 + y^2})\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is an open subset in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f : U \to \mathbb{R}\)</span> is a smooth function, then show that <span class="math inline">\(\sigma(x, y) := (x, y, f(x,y))\)</span> is a regular surface patch.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider a <span class="math inline">\(\gamma : (a, b) \to S \subset \mathbb{R}^3\)</span> parametrizing a curve that lies on the part of the surface covered by the surface patch. In other words, for each <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(t)\)</span> must, be in the image of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, i.e. there is some <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(y(t)\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>, so that <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(t) = \sigma(x(t), y(t))\)</span>. Assuming that <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y(t)\)</span> are smooth,</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Consider the part of the surface covered by <span class="math inline">\(\sigma : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma(x,y) = (\cos(x), \sin(x), y)\)</span> and consider the curve <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(t)=(0, 0, t)\)</span>. Note that it lies on the surface. Write it in the form, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(t) = \sigma(x(t), y(t))\)</span> by finding suitable functions <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y(t)\)</span>. Do the same for the curve <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_2(t) = (\cos(t), -\sin(t), 0)\)</span> which also lies on the surface.</p></li>
<li><p>Show that <span class="math display">\[\dot{\gamma}(t_0) = x'(t_0)\sigma_x(x(t_0), y(t_0)) + y'(t_0)\sigma_y(x(t_0), y(t_0))\]</span></p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Show that <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_x(x_0,y_0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_y(x_0,y_0)\)</span> are each velocity vectors of curves that lie on the surface. Why are they linearly independent?</p></li>
<li><p>Why do the previous two exercises show that <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_x(x_0,y_0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_y(x_0,y_0)\)</span> are a basis for the tangent vectors?</p></li>
<li><p>Compute <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\mathbf{n}}(p)\)</span> for any point <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> on a plane. Show that it is constant.</p></li>
<li><p>Compute <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\mathbf{n}}(p)\)</span> for any point <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> on a sphere.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider a point <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> on the part of the surface covered by a surface patch. Therefore, it is of the form <span class="math inline">\(p = \sigma(x_0, y_0)\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> an <span class="math inline">\(y_0\)</span>. Consider <span class="math display">\[\hat{\mathbf{n}}(p) = \frac{\sigma_x(x_0,y_0) \times \sigma_y(x_0,y_0)}{\| \sigma_x(x_0,y_0) \times \sigma_y(x_0,y_0)\|}\]</span> which is a vector in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span> based at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Is it a tangent vector? Why or why not?</p></li>
<li><p>Why is its dot product with <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_x(x_0,y_0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_y(x_0,y_0)\)</span> zero?</p></li>
<li><p>Why is its dot product with <em>any</em> tangent vector (of the surface at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>) zero?</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Consider a smooth function from the surface to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f : S \to \mathbb{R}\)</span>. Show that the rate of change along any parametrization <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}|_{t=t_0}f(\gamma(t)))\)</span> depends on the partial derivatives of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> at the point <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(t_0)\)</span> and the velocity of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span>. (<em>Hint:</em> This is just a way of interpreting chain rule)</p></li>
<li><p>Consider <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\widetilde{\mathbf{n}}}(x,y) = \hat{\mathbf{n}}(\sigma(x,y))\)</span>. Note that if <span class="math inline">\(p = \sigma(x,y)\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\widetilde{\mathbf{n}}}(x,y) = \hat{\mathbf{n}}(p)\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\widetilde{\mathbf{n}}}\)</span> is simply <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\mathbf{n}}\)</span> written in terms of the coordinates provided by <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. Note also that if <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(t) = \sigma(x(t), y(t))\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\widetilde{\mathbf{n}}}(x(t),y(t)) = \hat{\mathbf{n}}(\gamma(t))\)</span>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Show that the rate of change of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\mathbf{n}}\)</span> along a parametrization <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> of a curve on the surface (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}|_{t=t_0}\hat{\mathbf{n}}(\gamma(t)))\)</span>) depends only on <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\mathbf{n}}\)</span> at the point <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(t_0)\)</span> and the velocity of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span>. (<em>Hint:</em> Apply the previous exercise to each coordinate of the function <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\widetilde{\mathbf{n}}}\)</span>. Why is it important to use <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\widetilde{\mathbf{n}}}\)</span> and not <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\mathbf{n}}\)</span>?)</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>From now on, we will assume that <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is a unit speed parametrization. Show that <span class="math inline">\(\ddot{\gamma}(t_0) . \hat{\mathbf{n}}(\gamma(t_0)) = - \dot{\gamma}(t_0) . \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}|_{t=t_0}\hat{\mathbf{n}}(\gamma(t))\)</span>. Along with the previous exercise, this shows that the component of the acceleration in the direction of the normal, (denoted <span class="math inline">\(\kappa_n(t_0)\)</span>) depends only on the normal to the surface and the direction of a unit speed parametrization.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the other component of the acceleration, <span class="math inline">\(\ddot{\gamma}(t_0) - \ddot{\gamma}(t_0) . \hat{\mathbf{n}}(\gamma(t_0))\)</span>. Why is <span class="math inline">\(\ddot{\gamma}(t_0)\)</span> perpendicular to <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\mathbf{n}}(\gamma(t_0))\)</span>? Why is <span class="math inline">\(\ddot{\gamma}(t_0)\)</span> parallel to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}(t_0) \times \hat{\mathbf{n}}(\gamma(t_0))\)</span>? Let the magnitude be denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\kappa_g(t_0)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Show that <span class="math inline">\(\kappa^2(t_0) = \kappa_n^2(t_0) + \kappa_g^2(t_0)\)</span>. (<em>Hint:</em> <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}(t_0)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\mathbf{n}}(\gamma(t_0))\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}(t_0) \times \hat{\mathbf{n}}(\gamma(t_0))\)</span> form an orthonormal basis in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span>. Use the previous exercise.)</p></li>

<h2 id="applications-of-the-inverse-function-theorem">Applications of the Inverse Function Theorem</h2>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This topic is a bit more advanced, however, luckily, you should be able to follow the rest of the course even if you do not understand the concepts covered in this section of the exercise set. In this course, the inverse function theorem is used only to justify smoothness of certain functions so that we are permitted to differentiate as much as we like. While it is certainly in the syllabus, since it is a an isolated and more difficult topic, it is better to worry about it only if you have understood the other more basic and more widely used concepts that are covered in the previous section of this exercise set.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_1: U_1 \to S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_2 : U_2 \to S\)</span> denote two regular surface patches that cover exactly the same part of the surface.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{xy}(x, y, z) = (x, y)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{yz}(y, z) = (x, y)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{xz}(x, z) = (x, y)\)</span> denote the three projections obtained by dropping one of the coordinates. Show that the regularity of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_1\)</span> at some point <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> implies that the Jacobian of <span class="math inline">\(F_1(x,y) := \pi(\sigma_1(x,y))\)</span> is invertible, where <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> denotes one of these three projections.</p></li>
<li><p>Show that the projection, <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, from the previous exercise is injective when restricted to small enough neighbourhood of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(F_2(x,y) := \pi(\sigma_2(x,y))\)</span>. Show that <span class="math inline">\(\Phi(x,y) = \sigma_1^{-1} (\sigma_2(x,y)) = F_1^{-1} (F_2(x,y))\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Why is <span class="math inline">\(F_1^{-1}\)</span> smooth? Therefore, why is <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> smooth?</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>We have already discussed that for a parametrization, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>, of a curve on a surface, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(t) = \sigma(x(t), y(t))\)</span>. Show that <span class="math inline">\(x(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y(t)\)</span> are smooth functions. (<em>Hint:</em> Observe that <span class="math inline">\((x(t), y(t)) = \sigma^{-1}(\gamma(t))\)</span>. Use the “right” projection just as in the previous exercise to express this composition as a more convenient composition.)</p></li>
