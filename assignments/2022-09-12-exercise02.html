        <ol>
<li><p>In an earlier exercise you found the parametrization of a line segment joining two points. Use that parametrization to find the arc length of the line segment in terms of its end points. Try with some other parametrization too.</p></li>
<li><p>These steps will show that the line segment joining two points is the shortest possible curve joining the two points:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Show that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}. \mathbf{w} \leq \|\mathbf{v} \| \|\mathbf{w}  \|\)</span> for any two vectors <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{w}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Show that <span class="math inline">\(\|\mathbf{v} \| = \mathbf{v} . \frac{\mathbf{v} }{\|\mathbf{v}\| }\)</span>. This provides another way to obtain the norm of a vector: take its dot product with a unit vector in the same direction.</p></li>
<li><p>The previous part shows that <span class="math inline">\(\|\gamma(t_1) - \gamma(t_0)\| = (\gamma(t_1) - \gamma(t_0))  . \frac{\gamma(t_1) - \gamma(t_0)}{\| \gamma(t_1) - \gamma(t_0) \|}\)</span>. Now use the fundamental theorem of calculus to (carefully!) prove that <span class="math inline">\(\|\gamma(t_1) - \gamma(t_0)\| = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} \dot{\gamma}(t)  . \frac{\gamma(t_1) - \gamma(t_0)}{\| \gamma(t_1) - \gamma(t_0) \|}\mathrm{d}t\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Use the previous and first part to prove that <span class="math inline">\(\|\gamma(t_1) - \gamma(t_0)\| \leq \int_{t_0}^{t_1} \|\dot{\gamma}(t)\|\mathrm{d}t\)</span>. Note that this shows that the distance between the end points is always less than or equal to the arc length of a curve joining the two end points.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>If a parametrization <span class="math inline">\(\gamma :(\alpha,\beta) \to \mathbb{R}^3\)</span> satisfies the condition that <span class="math inline">\(\|\ddot{\gamma}(t)\| = 0\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, what kind of curve will it trace out?</p></li>
<li><p>If a parametrization <span class="math inline">\(\gamma :(\alpha,\beta) \to \mathbb{R}^3\)</span> satisfies the condition that <span class="math inline">\(\ddot{\gamma}(t)\)</span> is constant, what kind of curve will it trace out?</p></li>
<li><p>For a regular plane curve parametrized by <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(t)\)</span>, the curve parametrized by <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_c(t) := \gamma(t) + c \mathbf{N}_s(t)\)</span> for some fixed number <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, is said to be "parallel to the curve parametrized by <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(t)\)</span>".</p>
<ol>
<li><p>What is the curve parallel to a circle of radius <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>?</p></li>
<li><p>Prove that the <span class="math inline">\(\dot{\gamma}_c(t)\)</span> is a scalar multiple of <span class="math inline">\(\dot{\gamma}(t)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Compute the signed curvature of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_c(t)\)</span> in terms of the signed curvature fuction, <span class="math inline">\(k(t)\)</span>, for <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>. You will need to assume that <span class="math inline">\(k(t) \neq 1/c\)</span>. Hint: Just as in the previous exercise, it may be useful to express <span class="math inline">\(\ddot{\gamma}_c(t)\)</span> in terms of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{N}_s(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}(t)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{N}_s(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}(t)\)</span> are the unit normal and unit tangent vectors, respectively, of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(t)\)</span> and compute the coefficients by taking the dot product with appropriate vectors.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>If a curve parametrized by <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> has signed curvature function <span class="math inline">\(\kappa_s(t)\)</span>, what is the signed curvature of the curve parametrizaed by <span class="math inline">\(c\gamma(t)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is some constant?</p></li>
<li><p>Consider a (plane) curve parametrized by unit speed parametrization <span class="math inline">\(\gamma : (a, b) \to \mathbf{R}^2\)</span> and a point on that curve <span class="math inline">\(p = \gamma(t_0)\)</span>. We will find a circle which best approximates the curve at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, in the sense defined below. This will give another perspective on curvature. To solve this exercise, you need to be familiar with using derivatives to find out local maxima or minima.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Prove that if a circle is tangent to the curve defined by <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> ("tangent" means that the circle touches the curve and the circle’s tangent line and the curve’s tangent line are the same at p), then its center must lie on the line containing the vector <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{N}_s(t)\)</span>. For this and the part below you may assume that a normal line of a circle contains its center.</p></li>
<li><p>For some real number <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, let <span class="math inline">\(C_r\)</span> denote the circle of radius <span class="math inline">\(|r|\)</span>, with its center at the point <span class="math inline">\(p + r\mathbf{N}_s(t)\)</span>. Why is it tangent to the curve at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>? Note that <span class="math inline">\(C_r\)</span> divides the plane into an interior and exterior component and <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> may be negative, in which case the center is in a direction opposite to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{N}_s(t)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Prove that a point <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(t)\)</span> avoids the interior component of <span class="math inline">\(C_r\)</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">\(d(t) := \|\gamma(t) - (p + r\mathbf{N}(t))\|^2 \geq r^2\)</span> and avoids the exterior component if and only if <span class="math inline">\(d(t) \leq r^2\)</span> (it always intersects the circle at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, so at <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> you get <span class="math inline">\(r^2\)</span>). The square is only to allow us to express it as a dot product. Since <span class="math inline">\(d(t)\)</span> always positive, taking the square is harmless.</p></li>
<li><p>We say that <span class="math inline">\(C_r\)</span> is too small if, at least in the vicinity of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, every point on the curve defined by <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> avoids the interior of <span class="math inline">\(C_r\)</span>, i.e. there is an <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> so that for any <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> inside the interval <span class="math inline">\((t_0 - \epsilon, t_0 + \epsilon)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(t)\)</span> avoids the interior of <span class="math inline">\(C_r\)</span>. Use the previous part to rewrite this in terms of the function <span class="math inline">\(d(t)\)</span>, which is defined above. Why does that mean that <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> has a local minimum at <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span>? Remember that a function has a local minimum at <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> if for <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> *in the vicinity* of <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f(t) \geq f(t_0)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>We say that <span class="math inline">\(C_r\)</span> is too big if, at least in the vicinity of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, every point on the curve defined by <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> avoids the exterior of <span class="math inline">\(C_r\)</span>, i.e. there is an <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> so that for any <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> inside the interval <span class="math inline">\((t_0 - \epsilon, t_0 + \epsilon)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(t)\)</span> avoids the exterior of <span class="math inline">\(C_r\)</span>. Use the previous part to rewrite this in terms of the function <span class="math inline">\(d(t)\)</span>, which is defined above. Why does that mean that <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> has a local maximum at <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span>?</p></li>
<li><p>Prove that no matter what <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is, <span class="math inline">\(d'(t_0) = 0\)</span>. (By now you should be in the habit of expressing such derivatives in terms of that orthonormal basis <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{N}_s(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}(t)\)</span> so that you can easily identify which coefficients cancel).</p></li>
<li><p>Remember that a function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> has a local maximum at <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(f'(t_0)=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f''(t_0)&lt;0\)</span>; it has a local minimum at <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(f'(t_0)=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f''(t_0)&gt;0\)</span>. Compute <span class="math inline">\(d''(t)\)</span> and use parts d) and e) above to show that <span class="math inline">\(C_r\)</span> would be too big if <span class="math inline">\(r&gt;1/\kappa(t_0)\)</span> and too small if <span class="math inline">\(r &lt; 1/\kappa(t_0)\)</span>. Therefore, a circle of radius <span class="math inline">\(1/\kappa(t_0)\)</span> may be thought of as best approximating the curve at <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Such a circle is called an <em>osculating circle</em> and its radius is <span class="math inline">\(1/\kappa(t_0)\)</span> is called the radius of curvature.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\gamma : (\alpha,\beta) \to \mathbb{R}^2\)</span> be a regular <em>unit speed</em> parametrization of <strong>space</strong> curves. As with plane curves, we can define <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}(t):=\dot{\gamma}(t)\)</span>.</p>
<p>For a plane curve, there are only two unit vectors normal to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}(t)\)</span> for a given <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, but now there are infinitely many (why?). So for space curves, we choose the “normal” in the direction of the acceleration:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Assume that the (ordinary, <em>not</em> signed) curvature, <span class="math inline">\(\kappa(t) \neq 0\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Show that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{N}(t) := \frac{\ddot{\gamma}(t)}{\kappa(t)} = \frac{\dot{\mathbf{T}}}{\|\dot{\mathbf{T}}\|}\)</span> is a non-zero unit vector orthogonal to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}(t)\)</span>. Why is <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{N}(t)\)</span> smooth?</p></li>
<li><p>Define <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}(t) := \mathbf{T}(t) \times \mathbf{N}(t)\)</span>. Prove that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}(t)\)</span> is perpendicular to both <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{N}(t)\)</span>. Why is it smooth?</p></li>
<li><p>By the previous part, <span class="math inline">\(\{\mathbf{T}(t), \textbf{N}(t), \mathbf{B}(t)\}\)</span> form an orthonormal basis. So, <span class="math display">\[\dot{\mathbf{T}}(t) = x_T(t) \mathbf{T}(t) + y_T(t) \mathbf{N}(t) + z_T(t) \mathbf{B}(t)\]</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(x_T(t), y_T(t), z_T(t)\)</span>. What are these coefficients, <span class="math inline">\(x_T(t), y_T(t), z_T(t)\)</span>? This should be straightforward (follows from part 1).</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, <span class="math display">\[\dot{\mathbf{N}}(t) = x_N(t) \mathbf{T}(t) + y_N(t) \mathbf{N}(t) + z_N(t) \mathbf{B}(t)\]</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(x_N(t), y_N(t), z_N(t)\)</span>. What are the coefficients, <span class="math inline">\(x_N(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y_N(t)\)</span>? <span class="math inline">\(z_N(t)\)</span> will need to be done later. (<em>Hint:</em> As with plane curves, figuring out the coefficient involves taking an appropriate dot product. Sometimes, product rule may help you to shift the derivative and relate it with a known dot product. Remember that unit vector fields are orthgonal to their derivatives!)</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, <span class="math display">\[\dot{\mathbf{B}}(t) = x_B(t) \mathbf{T}(t) + y_B(t) \mathbf{N}(t) + z_B(t) \mathbf{B}(t)\]</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(x_B(t), y_B(t), z_B(t)\)</span>. Show that <span class="math inline">\(x_B(t) = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z_B(t) = 0\)</span>. In other words <span class="math inline">\(\dot{\mathbf{B} }(t)\)</span> is always a scalar multiple of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{N}(t)\)</span> (which is denoted <span class="math inline">\(y_B(t)\)</span> above).</p></li>
<li><p>Show that <span class="math inline">\(y_B(t) = -z_N(t)\)</span>. So the only two unknown coefficients are negatives of each other! Let us denote <span class="math inline">\(-y_B(t)\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(\tau(t)\)</span> (the negative sign is only a convention and simplifies some notation later). <span class="math inline">\(\tau(t)\)</span> is a new term that cannot be written in terms of known terms like the curvature etc and is called the “torsion” at <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. We have shown that the derivatives of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}(t)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{N}(t)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}(t)\)</span> can be written in terms of the basis <span class="math inline">\(\{\mathbf{T}(t), \textbf{N}(t), \mathbf{B}(t)\}\)</span> and the coefficients depend only on the curvature or the torsion.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Prove that the torsion <span class="math inline">\(\tau(t)\)</span>, defined in the previous question, of a curve is the constant 0 if and only if the curve lies on a plane.</p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_1(t), \mathbf{v}_2(t), \mathbf{v}_3(t)\)</span>, denote some vector fields which are <em>not necessarily</em> <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}(t), \mathbf{N}(t), \mathbf{B}(t)\)</span>, but nevertheless satisfy the same equations: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  \dot{\mathbf{v}_1}&amp;= \kappa(t) \mathbf{v}_2(t) \\
    \dot{\mathbf{v}_2} &amp;=  -\kappa(t) \mathbf{v}_1(t) +  \tau(t) \mathbf{v}_3(t)  \\
    \dot{\mathbf{v}_3} &amp;=  -\tau(t) \mathbf{v}_2(t)  \\
  \end{aligned}\]</span> Show that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}_i(t).\mathbf{v}_j(t)\)</span> are constant for any <span class="math inline">\(i,j\)</span> (<em>Hint:</em> Product rule, of course!). So, the angles and magnitudes remain the same for all <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. We will see the significance of this exercise during the lecture.</p></li>
<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}(t)\)</span> denote a unit vector field. Prove that there is always a unit speed parametrization, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> so that <span class="math inline">\(\dot{\gamma}(t)=\mathbf{v}(t)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider two parametrizations, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_1 : (\alpha,\beta) \to \mathbb{R}^3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_2 : (\alpha,\beta) \to \mathbb{R}^3\)</span> (note that they have the same domains). Denote the unit tangent, unit normal, and unit binormal of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_1\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}_1(t)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{N}_1(t)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}_1(t)\)</span>. Similarly, denote the unit tangent, unit normal, and unit binormal of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_2\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}_2(t)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{N}_2(t)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{B}_2(t)\)</span>. Assume also that both parametrizations have exactly the same curvature and torsion at <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\kappa(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tau(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Show that the expression <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}_1(t) . \mathbf{T}_2(t) + \mathbf{N}_1(t) . \mathbf{N}_2(t) + \mathbf{B}_1(t) . \mathbf{B}_2(t)\)</span> is constant.</p></li>
